# Crispy Notes - Notes and Character Sheet Storage

## Project Problem:
Whether you're a veteran Game Master struggling to keep your notes
in one place, or a new player that wants to make a new character
sheet quick and easy, it's hard to find a single app or website
for doing so. While companion apps exist, they may only exist for
one specific game. Wouldn't it be nice to have everything in a
single web page/app?

## Project Goal
### Minimum Viable Product:
* Use a login system for users
* Allow users to create and store:
    * Notes
    * Character Sheets
    * Maps
* Allow users to import other files (such as .pdf, .txt, etc.). 
  Users can then use the imported file as is or copy from the
  original file to a file on Crispy Notes.
